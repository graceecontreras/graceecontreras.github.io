### CPSC 120 Favorite Labs

* Lab 3

    All of lab 3 was one of my favorites because my lab partner was able to help me a lot in terms of understanding how to code and implement the things we had learned in class. Even just watching my partner code and listening as he explained what he was doing helped me immensely. After this lab, I was able to code things on my own way easier and understand the process of going about the labs way easier as well. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 as a whole was definitely my favorite. With this lab, I realized I could code well enough on my own. I coded most of the lab myself and being able to complete it all the way through on my own made me feel more confident about coding and being in computer science. I also learned how fix linting and formatting errors really efficiently with lab and have been able to consistently fix such errors with realitive ease since then.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was another favorite of mine because it really helped understand range based loops as well as vectors. Before doing this lab, I really struggled with vectors, but for some reason when this lab had 2D vectors, the concept of vectors finally clicked for me. Learning how to go through a vector's components one by one with a range based loop helped me understand how to use range based loops and also helped my understanding of vectors.
